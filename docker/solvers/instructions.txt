# For CPLEX

Place here the folder /ibm that is installed by CPLEX (usually in /opt).
You actually only need the following substructure (makes the container lighter):
.
└───ibm
    └───ILOG
        └───CPLEX_Studio1271
            └───cplex
                ├───bin
                ├───include
                ├───lib
                └───python
				
# For Gurobi

Place here the tarball you got from the website, and modify accordingly the files:
	../utils/install_gurobi.sh 
	../utils/activate_gurobi.sh

You will need a license key to put in the template in ../utils/activate_gurobi.sh
